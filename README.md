# picture-in-picture

Pure javascript app which allows you to watch anything on a 'second' screen. 

Uses the Screen Capture API. Made with a simple async-await function. Always stays on top of other apps, so visible wherever you are on your computer, resizable and straight forward. No more Google Chrome extension :)
